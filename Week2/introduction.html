		<h2>Reader, Dreamer, Aspiring Web Developer</h2>
		<hr>
		
		<p>My name is Rheanna and I am currently self-studying to become a web developer! I work in IT and have a B.S. degree in computer engineering, but Javascript and related languages are relatively new to me. I am looking forward to building interesting websites and learning new technologies with a community of like-minded peers!</p>

		<p>When I'm not coding, I like to spend my time: </p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Working Out</li>
			<li>Reading (esp. Stephen King)</li>
			<li>Baking</li>
			<li>Browsing Reddit</li>
			<li>Playing with my cats</li>
			<li>Listening podcasts on Spotify</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>That's me, I look forward to getting to know you too!</h3>
